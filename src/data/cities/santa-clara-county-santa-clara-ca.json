She was so nice and helpful. I must have asked a million questions and there was a lot of back and forth emails but every communication I had with her was nothing but professional, patient, and informative. She helped me immensely in planning and coordinating a new fence build of which I had no prior knowledge or experience with. After our dealings I’m actually pretty educated on wood fencing!
