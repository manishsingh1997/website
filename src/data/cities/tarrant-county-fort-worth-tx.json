When my fence blew down, I scrambled to find a company and recieve quotes for the repair. Most of the CSRs from other companies accosted me with texts and calls. If I didn't respond immediately, they moved on to the next unkowing victim. And then there was Kelly from Ergeon. Patient, kind, helpful, and ready to do whatever I needed at MY pace. When I finally contacted her, she set-up a virtual visit, sent me a variety of options, responded immediately, and was super kind in the process. I am grateful for her assistance thus far and if the rest of my experience with Ergeon is a fabulous as it has been with Kelly, I will send everyone I know to her. Thanks Kelly!","name":"Kt.
