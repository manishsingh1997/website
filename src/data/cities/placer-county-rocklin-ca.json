Everything came together without a hitch. Sam (project manager) was very helpful with timelines and the installers were adept at improvising with fence design changes. Besides the fences 2 gates had to be installed. One of the gates had to be redesigned because it was originally made on a metal frame. The estimate included 3 versions, lowest cost to most expensive.","name":"Lon M.","title":"From the Google Meet video (contactless) for the estimate to the masked installers, everything came together without a hitch.","address":"Saguro Way, Rocklin","url":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/ergeon-sacramento-3?hrid=l9CpMi6__gs1K7LvhioPKw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)","img":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uqyqL3xco9l2_2zrYt66nhISOqFRg59k/view?usp=sharing"},"Google":{"description":"Very pleased with the whole process from the Google Meet video (contactless) for the estimate to the installers.
