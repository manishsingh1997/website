Within a day I received a call from Ergeon who was able to answer all the questions I had and was able to work with my busy schedule in setting up a video call with me to go over what I should expect. Diego was very helpful and willing to assist in anyway he can. He set me up with a quote for the whole project and also broke down the costs and what to expect (in case I decide to break the project into phases).","name":"Colleen G.","title":"Within a day I received a call from Ergeon who was able to answer all the questions","address":"Birchwood Ct, Union City","url":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/ergeon-oakland-3?hrid=9VVHCo9uj2EcsgO_SY0C1Q&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)","img":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DyZ8qVzzXkW_V_NHVEmPzpLsugw_rBxJ/view?usp=sharing"},"Google":{"description":"My rep Andrea was EXTREMELY AWESOME and HELPFUL.
