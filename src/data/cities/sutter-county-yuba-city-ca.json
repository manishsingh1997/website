We have a larger yard and after collecting several quotes eregon was the best price. On top of that their estimate and quote process was the easiest and most professional. We have small kiddos and small dogs so we were concerned about the time to replace the fence. Eregon's crew had the old fence down and the new one up in only 2 days! Every member of the crew was friendly and professional, and our fence looks beautiful.
