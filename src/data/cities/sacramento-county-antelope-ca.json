From the quote process to scheduling to install, the process was easy and I always felt like I was a valued customer. I would recommend them for any fence install. They even split the invoice between us and our neighbors and billed us separately, just adding to the seamless nature of their work. All fences come with a warranty as well, which is wonderful! We will definitely consider them for future projects and have already recommended them to family and coworkers! You just can't go wrong here.","name":"Rachel M.","title":"Finding a contractor that is reasonably priced, with great customer service is very hard , but Ergeon gets it done!","address":"Hunter Leigh Pl, Antelope","url":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/ergeon-sacramento-3?hrid=E0w1i1-0CErv4X6Uvfb9EQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)","img":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1upLPDyK1oirAYCAvRPw5lfYmasvNC4qX/view?usp=sharing"},"Google":{"description":"Daniel Valenzuela was very helpful in doing a review of my project on video conference call, he was helpful in getting me through the setup of my iphone and how to hold my phone.
