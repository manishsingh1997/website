            <li>
              It’s very hard to just repair parts of a fence since the panels are structurally connected. If someone
              offers you a repair, they may break other parts of the fence as they are removing panels and then it
              may end up costing you more.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you only repair parts of the fence, you’ll have mismatched panels that have aged differently.
              This creates a generally undesirable appearance.

          <p>
            We offer a&nbsp;<strong>five-year warranty</strong>&nbsp;which covers any workmanship or installation
            related issues. Our Quality Assurance expert will examine each case individually and provide a solution.
            Please note that wood is an organic product and by nature has knots, black marks, and can crack,
            discolor, expand, contract, bow or twist. Some of this is to be expected and is not considered defective
            nor covered by warranty. Any defective material will be visible within weeks of the installation.

            Your fence installation depends on linear footage and the type of fence you choose. To provide you a fast
            and hassle-free quote, we create an exterior blueprint of your property through publicly available
            satellite imagery and base your price off those measurements.

        answer: (
          <p>
            Because we typically use redwood for our fences, you can expect a lifespan of around 25 years with regular
            maintenance. Other types of lumber will typically only last 5-15 years because they’re not as resistant
            to rot and insects like redwood is.

            It typically takes one day to install 60 feet of fencing if there are no added challenges.

            Pricing is based on linear footage of fencing you need. We confirm those measurements in
            person during an on site visit. The type of fence you choose and whether or not it has a
            gate also affects the price.

            We can also install a matching gate, for an additional charge. Gates are made of the same material

        question: 'Why should I replace my driveway vs. repairing it?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            It’s very hard to just repair parts of the driveway since the sections are connected.
            If someone breaks apart the existing section to replace it, it can easily break adjacent
            sections as well, which will cost you more.
            The new section also may not match in color with the old section as concrete and pavers do change
            appearance as they age. Crack repair is potentially possible but it does not structurally repair
            the slab and the aesthetics will never match. A full replacement addresses these concerns.

              Pavers: Ergeon guarantees the quality of materials with the manufacturer’s lifetime warranty and all
              of Ergeon’s workmanship for twenty five (25) years following the completion of the project.
              Site inspection revealing any paver breaking, shifting, or moving stemming from any defective
              workmanship or defective material will be fixed and/or replaced at no additional charge. If any issues
              arise within this time frame, reach out to your Project Manager with a description of the issue,
              location on the project, and pictures. Ergeon will send a Regional Manager for site inspection. &nbsp;
              All warranty claims must be verified and approved by Construction Manager prior to any repair or
              replacement being approved.&nbsp;Pavers replaced under warranty will be replaced with new stock and
              may not perfectly match heavily weathered or aged pavers on site.

              and provide a solution. Please note that concrete as a material will inevitably have some hairline
              cracks especially as California has frequent earthquakes, any cracks thicker than a nickel are
              considered a structural issue and not cosmetic.

        answer: (
          <p>
            Your driveway installation price depends both on the square footage, the type of materials you choose,
            and site factors such as soil type, drainage, or vegetation around the driveway such as large trees.
            To provide you a fast and hassle-free quote, we create an exterior blueprint of your property through
            publicly available satellite imagery and base your price off those measurements.

        question: 'How long will my new driveway last?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            We use high-grade specifications of fresh base rock, rebar, and a minimum of 4 inches of 3500 psi concrete
            or high-grade pavers, so your new driveway will typically last 20-30 years.
            For comparison, driveway installations that don’t match our specifications will only last 5-15 years.
            Cracks are expected in all concrete driveways after even a couple of years but you should experience
            no structural issues for many years.

            <p>
              A typical installation takes 3-5 days for 600-800 square feet. On day one, we will demo the existing
              driveway, excavate the area, and haul away the debris.
              Then we will lay down the base rock and install rebar for structural rigidity.

                For a standard concrete driveway, concrete will be poured in, then finished with a broom finish or
                stamped and stained. After the installation is complete, it will take at least 7 days to cure the
                concrete (allowing for a complete chemical reaction of the cement) before the driveway can be used
                for anything other than walking.

              <li>
                For a paved driveway, sand will be poured in, then pavers will be installed. Paved driveways can

        answer: (
          <p>
            Yes. We try to give at least one day&apos;s notice before scheduling a pre-visit for the next day.

            <p>
              You do not need to be home for this pre-visit, unless you want to discuss any specific issues related
              to your particular project. &nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              All we need is your permission to enter the property, so our installer can mark for utilities and take
              a look at the site and verify measurements. &nbsp;We will give you a heads up, so you can leave the gate
              open for us and keep pets inside that day.

        question: 'I need to make arrangements for the pre-visit because \
          I have dogs / other access issues / I am uncomfortable leaving the gate open.',
        answer: (
          <p>
            No problem. We always try to work with you and find a time when you can meet the installer.
            Sometimes it may be possible to verify measurements from your
            neighbor&apos;s side, if you help us coordinate with them.

      },
      {
        question: 'What time will you arrive for the pre-visit?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            It is difficult to give you an exact time. Our installers typically do their pre-visits when they are
            working on another project close by to your home.
          </p>
        ),

      {
        question: 'How do I know that someone came by for the pre-visit?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            If you met with one of our onsite estimators and your property was not marked at that point, you will
            see a white arrow curbside and/or white flags close to your gate or along the new fence line.

        question: 'How quickly can I get on the installation schedule?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            We try to get your project scheduled within 20 days of your quote approval date. In some cases,
            scheduling can take a bit longer. Examples are: weather related delays, removal of vegetation or
            trees, and changes to the project scope.

      },
      {
        question: 'When will you arrive for the installation?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Our crew will arrive between 8 - 10 a.m. on the day of the installation.
            We allow some buffer for traffic and material pick up.

        question: 'Do I need to be home for the fence installation?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Yes, please aim to be home between 8-10 a.m. for an initial walk-through.
            Then once more when the crew is finishing the installation to do a final walk-through.
            This minimizes miscommunication and ensures the best outcome for you.

        question: "Can you start framing the same day that the posts are set in concrete? \
          Doesn't it take at least one day for the posts to set?",
        answer: (
          <p>
            By the time all posts are set in concrete, it has dried enough to start the framing.
            We add the pickets last. It takes at least 30 days for the concrete to fully cure, so please do not
            move the fence and test it for stability.

        question: 'Will you haul away the debris?',

            Yes, we will haul your old fence boards away.

      {
        question: 'Will you also remove additional debris, such as old yard furniture?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Unfortunately we cannot remove additional debris, as different types of debris need to be disposed of
            separately at the landfill.

      {
        question: 'Will you put up a temporary fence for the pool/dogs/chickens?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            It is the homeowner&apos;s responsibility to arrange for temporary fencing if there is a pool on
            the property and the project takes more than one day. Please keep all pets either indoors or in
            a secure area, separate from where our crew is working.
