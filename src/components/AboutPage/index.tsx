          <p>
            We are disrupting the multi-trillion-dollar construction industry with a global skilled workforce and
            technology. We empower our customers, contractors, and staff to become their own superheroes.
            <br />
            <br />
            We believe that projects should be done on time, on budget, and with reliable quality. Our customers are
            provided with the best support from a highly qualified global workforce and they have access to
            user-friendly, proprietary technology allowing them to visualize, plan and build their projects. This opens
            the door to fast, responsive, and friendly service, transparent pricing, and quality craftsmanship. As a
            result, any property owner can make their home better without any stress; and enjoy it more with their
            family and friends.
            <br />
            <br />
            Starting with outdoor construction, we install the highest quality fence projects and we are on track toward
            scaling to larger complex building projects. Over 8,000 happy customers are now enjoying the fences weâ€™ve
            built for them. We were named Best of HomeAdvisor 2020, with over 2,000 public reviews at an average rating
            of 4.6. We have expanded across multiple states in the past four years to cover over 12% of U.S. households
            in our service areas! Our company was founded and is run today by two CS Ph.D. serial entrepreneurs.
